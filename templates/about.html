    <h2> About Page </h2>
    <p>AGI Ticker Tape (AGITT) is meant to be a general-purpose Q&A system. That is, a user may query this system and it should be able to provide an answer which is in line with one expected from an expert on the subject, without being limited to a narrow range of topics. </p>

  <p>Traditionally, expert systems store a system of facts and reason using a variation of an algorithm such as forward or backward chaining, along with some probability calculations. This is effective for certain tasks but does not generalize well, as the reasoning pipeline is often highly coupled to the facts themselves. With this project, we aim to create a system that extends the capabilities of traditional expert systems by allowing for the hot-swapping of user-created topic experts used to reason based on the query. The architecture for these topic experts has already been created by our client (Carl Goran) and includes neural-based structures in addition to GOFAI reasoning pipelines to allow for pattern recognition and automatic database modification. </p>

  <p>Following a query, AGITT will first select an topic expert that it deems reliable to answer the query given. The
topic expert chosen will then select information from its belief database which is deemed to be relevant. Each piece of information in the belief database will be an ordered tuple. This collection of ordered tuples will serve as an input to the topic expert. </p>

  <p>During processing, it may retrieve any other information it feels is relevant but does not currently possess from the internet and store it in its NOVA database to be used. It may also ask the user additional questions to retrieve information about their personal circumstances. A list of potential answers to the query will then be generated based on the data within the belief database. Following processing, one answer out of the list will be selected and output with a confidence interval, which represents how certain the topic expert is of its selected answer. Following output, the user will rate the answer for how they agree with the topic expert's output, which the neuronal component of the topic expert uses to learn further and adjust its internal weights via reinforcement learning.</p>

  <p>Since the project is primarily experimental, development will follow an Agile approach, with refinements to components being made over a period of sprints. Tentatively, the SQL databases will be placed on Microsoft Azure.</p>
